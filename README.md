# microprofiler

Low-level profiling for node.js: squeeze those microseconds!

Microprofiler allows you to measure performance of your code down to the level of the microsecond,
allowing micro-optimizations that are unfeasible any other way.

Instead of blind profiling your entire code, insert probes whenever needed and measure only
at interesting points.

## Installation

Simply install from npm:

    $ npm install microprofiler

Or add to your package.json as a dependency.

## Usage

First require use of microprofiler:

    var profiler = require('microprofiler');

Locate a portion of code you want to measure. Insert a measurement before it starts:

    var start = profiler.start();

The function `profiler.start()` is simply an alias to `process.hrtime()`,
which returns time with nanosecond precision.

After the block of code ends, insert a measurement passing a key:

    profiler.measureFrom(start, 'code');

Optionally pass a number of requests after which a trace will be shown.

To show current stats for a given key, use `profiler.show()`:

    profiler.show('code');

That is really all there is to it.
